# 3D Watch Mount Models

![Demo Video](v4/v4_in_action.MOV)

This was a side project to create a 3D printed mount for my watch. The mount is designed to be attached to a Bontrager BLNDR Stem Mount Trip Computer Ion 100 200 350 450 Comp Elite, shown [here](required_BLNDR_stem_mount_base.jpeg). The mount is designed to hold a Garmin Fenix 3, but with a little toggling of parameters, you might be able to get it working for your own model.

## Structure

- `v1/`: This directory includes both the Fusion 3D (.f3d) and STL (.stl) files. Which was designed to slide into the Bontrager BLNDR Stem Mount Computer plate.
- `v2/`: Contains the second iteration of the watch mount in STL format. This version was designed to be a little more secure and have a better fit.
- `v3/`: Contains the third iteration of the watch mount in STL format. Here, the print was designed to bolt into the mount base, removing the need for the plate.
- `v4/`: Contains the fourth iteration of the watch mount in STL format. This was designed to be as secure as possible and to be printed at the highest fill.

## Usage

V4 is ready to be printed, make sure your print orientation is correct. You want to print it so it can handle the tension of the watch. See [how not to print it](v1/v1_improper_print_orientation.pdf).

To make your own modifications, you may have to start from the [v1 f3d](v1/Watch Mount v1.f3d) design.
